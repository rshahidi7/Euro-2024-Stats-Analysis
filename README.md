# 📊 [Euro 2024 Statistical Analysis] – Interactive Tableau Dashboard

An interactive data visualization project exploring **The 2024 Euros**.  

This project explores player performance in the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament through interactive Tableau dashboards. The analysis has two dashboards, one including a comparison of all players and the other only comparing U21 prospects to eachother. This is done by examining their overall production (Goals + Assists) and playmaking influence.

To provide context, each dashboard is paired with a map visualization:
	•	All Players Dashboard: Shows each team’s total goals and which players contributed.
	•	U21 Prospects Dashboard: Highlights the number of young players on each team and the minutes they played.

Together, these dashboards allow for quick comparisons of top performers, emerging young talents, and team-level reliance on experience vs. youth.
